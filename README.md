# ThinkTwice

__*"Dish soap. Orange juice. Lay’s potato chips. These are some of the products I buy every week. But I don’t really think too much when it comes to buying these items. All I know is that as a student attending York University, for me, convenience is key."*__

These are the thoughts of the average university student, let's call him Aaron. What Aaron doesn’t consider, is that those Lay’s potato chip bags he buys so often end up in the landfill. The simple, mundane purchases that he makes on a weekly basis harm the environment in more ways than one. And you know what? Maybe, if Aaron knew that in the same store he already shops at, there were more eco-friendly options just down the aisle, he would Think Twice about his decisions. But he doesn’t.

This issue that Aaron faces is shared by the **1.7M** other university students across Canada. This got us thinking… _How might we encourage Canadian students in post-secondary institutions to purchase more environmentally responsible consumables, meaning products they buy from a grocery store?_

That’s why we created ThinkTwice. ThinkTwice is a mobile app which allows the user to go into a grocery store and simply take a picture of the product that they want to buy. Right away, the user would get immediate information on the sustainability of the packaging and the end of life of the product, meaning whether it's compostable, recyclable, or belongs in the landfill.
